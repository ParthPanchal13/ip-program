			<h2>“Students unable to score well enough to opt science go for commerce”</h2>

			<h2>“With commerce, I have only limited career options, such as CA, CS and B.Com”</h2>

			<h2>“Only students from a business-class family background should go for commerce”</h2>

			<p>The statements above are some ideas we have been led by our society, parents, and friends to believe, but hardly hold a candle to the truth. The truth, yes, is that the commerce stream, much in the same way as science, or humanities for that matter, opens up a plethora of career opportunities for students.</p>

			<p>While the long-standing norms for selecting streams in our country have dictated that toppers and academically-gifted students naturally drift towards science, it is a practice that is fast being overturned.
